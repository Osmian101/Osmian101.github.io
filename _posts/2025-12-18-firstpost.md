I've got the skeleton of a website up and running with GitHub Pages and Jekyll.  

There's no content for now, but the dream is to fill it out as I learn different things. The bones consist of a couple folders for creating blog posts, setting up page layouts, and defining topics to help organize the blog.  
My next steps are going to be adding proper static pages for Home, About, and Completed Projects.
In order to do that I need to do some research on Markdown (up?) to find
what will work best. After that I'll worry about styling everything past 'black background white foreground' into something more visually appealing and well laid out.

My primary reason for starting this project is to document, organize, and catalog my progress with various hobbies and skill building activities. Unfortunately this is also just a hobby project so progress on it will be slow.
